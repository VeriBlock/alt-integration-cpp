    Randomly executes `Node` and `MockMiner` methods.
    Instances of `Node` and `MockMiner` are wrapped with `RandomPopMiner`.
    There are following `RandomPopMiner` methods will be executed:
      - `submit_btc_tx`
      - `mine_btc_block`
      - `submit_vbk_pop_tx`
      - `submit_vbk_tx`
      - `mine_vbk_block`
      - `submit_pop_data`
      - `mine_alt_block`

    Invocation of `mine_vbk_blocks` differs for vbk pop transactions or usual vbk transactions.
    So we randomly choose one of them with weights=[`vtbs`, `atvs`], but keep `vbk_blocks` executions in total.

    Each invocation of `submit_vbk_pop_tx` or `submit_pop_data` requires at least one invocation of
    `submit_btc_tx` or `submit_vbk_tx` respectively before.
    So pairs of methods (`submit_btc_tx`, `submit_vbk_pop_tx`) and (`submit_vbk_tx`, `submit_pop_data`)
    should be executed in parentheses sequence order (see `parentheses_sequence` below).

    All of the invocations shuffled between each other (see `chain_random` below).

    Number of executions of each of these methods are defined by the corresponding arguments:
        `mine_xxx_blocks` will be executed exactly `xxx_blocks` times.
        `submit_btc_tx` and `submit_vbk_pop_tx` will be executed `vtbs` times.
        `submit_vbk_tx` and `submit_pop_data` will be executed `atvs` times.

def parentheses_sequence(open_item: object, close_item: object, n: int) -> List[object]:
    """
    Make a random list with 2*n items, which forms a parentheses sequence, e.g. (()())
    Each item is either `open_item` or `close_item`. Both of them exactly n times.

    If A and B are parentheses sequences, then (A)B is also parentheses sequence.
    Empty sequence is considered as correct parentheses sequence.

    Following the idea above, creating a parentheses sequence is made recursively.
    We put '(' at first position, then pick position for ')'.
    After that, we recursively create A and B sequences.

    The naive implementation is not correct, because possibilities of positions for ')' are not equal.
    We can't choose position uniformly, we need choose it with weights.
    These weights are defined by numbers of A and B sequences in form (A)B.
    Number of parentheses sequences with size 2*n is equal to nth Catalan number.
    Catalan number c[n] can be calculated recursively by formula:
        c[n] = { 1,                               for n = 0
               { sum[k=0->n-1] (c[k] * c[n-1-k]), for n > 0
        c[0] = 1
        c[1] = 1   ()
        c[2] = 2   ()(), (())
        c[3] = 5   ()()(), ()(()), (())(), (()()), ((()))

    Now, we can define weights for choosing position for ')'.
    Consider we have sequence with size 2*4 and we pick position 5 for ')'
        01234567
        (....)..
    There are c[2] = 2 sequences to put from 1 to 4 position,
    and c[1] = 1 sequence to put from 6 to 7 position.
    The weight for this position is equal to c[2] * c[1] = 2 * 1 = 2

    Finally, to create random parentheses sequence uniformly, we calculate Catalan numbers,
    then recursively generate parentheses sequence, picking position with weights.
